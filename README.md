# Parkinson-Disease-Detection
**This project is designed to facilitate the early detection of Parkinson's disease using Python, Flask, machine learning models, NumPy, and scikit-image. By analyzing spiral drawings, the system aims to provide a non-invasive and accessible tool for identifying potential symptoms.**

## Features

- **Early Detection:** The project focuses on early identification of Parkinson's disease through the analysis of spiral drawings, a common motor task affected by the disease.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Flask, the web application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Leveraging advanced ML algorithms, the models are trained to detect subtle patterns and anomalies in spiral drawings, ensuring accurate disease identification.

- **Accessibility:** The project aims to make Parkinson's detection accessible to a wider audience through a web-based platform.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language for implementing the project's functionalities.

- **Flask:** Web framework used for building the user interface and handling web requests.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Advanced algorithms for analyzing and detecting patterns in spiral drawings.

- **NumPy:** Library for efficient data manipulation.

- **scikit-image (skimage):** Image processing library for feature extraction and enhancement.
